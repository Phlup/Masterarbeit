We aim to develop a univeral system to predict the performance of the potential offspring generated
from populations in different breeding schemes for multiple traits and crop species

Hier kÃ¶nnte ihre Pipeline stehen!

1. Simulation of genotypes/phenotypes
1.1 stdpopsim libraries, mutation rate, genomic recombination map

2. Breeding scheme on simulated genotypes
2.1 schemes (AlphaSimR?)
n: individual genotype
n1...nk, k: genotypes
A k -> T(k) prediction of single phenotype given genotype (no breeding)
B k1, k2 -> T(k1 x k2) crossing
C k1, k2 -> max(T(O1), ..., T(Ol)) with Oj = k1 x k2 predicting max phenotype from parents
--> F1 generations, but consider F5 (after selfing, genotypes are homozygous)

3. ML prediction of phenotypes given breeding genotypes
3.1

4. Validation of simulated genotypes and phenotypes
4.1. use real data and population genetics theory
4.2. validation confidence based on real data availability
