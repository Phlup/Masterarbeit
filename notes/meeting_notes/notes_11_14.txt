fit curve through r^2 values

barplot
categories: physical distance
value: mean linkage disequilibrium among markers
boxplots next to each other

0.5, 1.0 r^2 in real population?

boxplot of euclidean distance in same plot and t test
change seed/populations

manhattan distance instaed of euclidean 
pairwise difference depends on evolutionary events in the beginning (divergence between founders)
10 independent simulation with different founder parents
-> accuracy of genetic map over all pairs of founders?
error rate of simulation: 5%? fine for commerical use

readme for use of script

easypheno iupac encoding

prediction: real data pheno+geno for training
genotypic simulated data
-> to fede

trait: silk/tassel, yield?

sommer: mixed models generate simulated phenotypic data
->  gca general combining ability, sca specific combining ability

1. scripts for different founders
2. give scripts to computomics for barley
3. genotype phenotype of founders and genotype simulated data of NAM pop -> geno to pheno prediction
3.1 geno->pheno prediction myself

no recombination model
-> what to validate it with?
-> or just vary recombination parameter and study
