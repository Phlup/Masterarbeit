how to enhance simulation of genotypes? parameterization?
-> ancestry simulation? forward simulation?
-> necessary data: genotypes, genetic maps, ...?

ancestry rarely important in breeding, except: ancestry of parent crosses for hybrid cultivars are closer than test cross -> lower inbreeding, higher heterosis
-> include ancestry into prediction model, is relatedness/inbreeding coefficient in closely related parents relevant factor?

breadth or depth -> general simulation engine supporting many different plants/breeding schemes (e.g. lines, hybrids; bulk selection, recurrent selection, ...)
		    or try to achieve best possible simulation and prediction accuracy for one species (e.g. maize)
program:
"pedigree class" as model supporting implementation of breeding schemes
"simulation" functions to simulate genotypes based on pedigree/breeding schemes, using varying complexity (all unlinked, linked w/ genetic maps,...)
"phenotype class" predict phenotype based on simulation using xseedscore, own method? temporary: ground truth for prediction
"prediction class" predict best parent cross for highest phenotypic value


either: do we train the model using simulated genotypes, validate it and use it as supervised ml model to predict best genos?
-> like genomic selection
-> how to validate?

or: do we simulate best phenotype values among all combinations of possible parent genotypes?
-> like phenotypic selection
-> how to deal with high variation? i.e. every simulation producing different results due to low probability of recomb.
-> include specific breeding goals, e.g. inclusion of known major QTL into final cultivar

pedigrees:
rules for implementation i.e. 2 parents per child (can be same parent, selfing), children can only be added to generation n+1
functions:
m x m all pairs and given pairs
selfing
parental->f1
