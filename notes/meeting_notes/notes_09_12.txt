genomic map with recombination rates (cM/Mb) for Maize RILs? Why only graphic not actual data
-> just divide cM by Mb, but lastSNP position - firstSNP to be more accurate

-> look into simulating multiple chromosomes in msprime. infinite recomb rate between?
just same simulation 10 times? with same pedigree

-> simulate whole population, compare genotype distribution with actual distribution
Fixation index, rogers distance, allele frequency spectrum genetic distances wiki + fst principles of popgen

data from breeding scheme to more accurately validate simulation? How did you train your phenotype prediction models?
