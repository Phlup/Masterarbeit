How to generate variability:
Crossing (parents), mutagenesis, gene transfer,...
-> Only crossing schemes considered?

Breeding steps:
E.g. Figure 16.5: Up to 10 Generations until cultivar release,
how many F generations for prediction pipeline? 
Which generations as input/output?
-> Year 1: desirable homozygous parents?
Improvement by more complex breeding schemes?
-> when to select and evaluate?
why e.g. P1 x P2 -> F1 -> selfing 5 times?
F1 hybrids seem important


which breeding methods involve genetic markers at all? Mass selectio no, pedigree selection yes?

See reinventing quantitative genetics (Bernardo R.)
-> approaches that are computational and empirical, 
rather than being based on classical theory and assumptions
-> Which classical theory and assumptions to include/reject? 
+ genetic maps 
+ ...
? genetic variance? epistasis, environmental,...
? Simple traits vs polygenic vs,...
- Reference population in HW equilibrium
- identifying major QTL alleles
