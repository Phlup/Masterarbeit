rate map data quality?
genetic maps -> without physical position
ordered by linkage equilibrium
ordered in different ways
discard the markers to be monotonic
predict non monotonic cM with splines in R
check if function for markers across physical marker fits mcmullen paper
-> map y axis position x rate is slope
-> low rate in centromer higher at ends
marrymap

distance metric?
linkage disequilibrium decay curve
create validation curves without "real data" -> validation rules
variance within simulated and real population
mean distance within populations compare to simulated population
more interested in within population diversity -> extreme values in breeding

just look at phenotype, compare to simulated phenotype in real data with same prediction method and markers used
validate by proxy of simulated phenotype
-> comapre different number of phenotpyes

more complex pedigree and genotypes available in literature, from computomics?
-> more complex in wheat
-> backcrosses also interesting
