1. scripts for different founders + (finish creating plots, sumstats over all outputs)
2. give scripts to computomics for barley +
3. genotype phenotype of founders and genotype simulated data of NAM pop -> geno to pheno prediction
3.1 geno->pheno prediction myself with lmm/cnn/rf etc.


stdpopsim: genetic map?

ridge regression for marker effects (effect per SNP)
gblup for genotypic effects (whole genome per individual)
rrblup very similar to genotypic effect

marker effects: plotting cum effect of parental crosses

summary statistic for overall scoring of error rate? 
metric of divergence between (probability) distributions? 
KL-divergence? 
2d-sliced wasserstein distance?


16.01. 11 am next meeting
