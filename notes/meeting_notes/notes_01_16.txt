calc rrblup for every population? or all at once
CNN, RF, XGBoost ideas for tuning? -> traits predict best performing in one example, validate?
add cM to rate or just cM
plot predicted vs real
add layer adapting to current parental step
e.g. domain adaptation adapting different domain -> compute mean difference add to predicted
use global marker effects
distance between traits between max and min of range of markers

discussion: traits might not be regionally explained in genome -> why correlation might be nonsensical
-> explainability low but prediction good

plot best performing and lowest performing crosses for marker traits (estimated globally)
randomly combining marker effects into offspring (binomially sampling)
send manuscript mid february if 80% done
