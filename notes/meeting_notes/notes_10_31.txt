measures to validate:
mean and variance with ancestral/derived allele
Linkage disequilibrium decay -> implemented where?
-> compare throughout generations?
-> for random recombination no recombination or specific genetic map
-> scale recombination rate so only total changes not relative
-> SNP distance vs LD (r^2)
distribution of genetic distance of individuals
-> to visualize extreme regions of offspring
additive relationship matrix or rogers distance
nucleotide diversity across sites -> implemented where?
SFS? unnecessary because homozygous and similar allele frequencies everywhere?
LDD curve kolmogorov smirnof test, learning parameter


high intraspecies variance of genetic map

phenotype prediction
phenotype map: phenotype effect of parents (per site) to total phenotype
