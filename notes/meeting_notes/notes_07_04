LITERATUR
paper zu roggen o.ä. genom für stdpopsim?

maize, sunflower? wheat, soybeans
-> monocots, dicots
-> breeding scheme are different?
-> hybrid breeding scheme?
-> working with multiple species beneficial
-> nam population?

bücher/paper zu plant breeding schemes, recombination selfing?
-> breeding scheme in code -> 1 crossing 5 selfing
backcross? -> implement, works if parents are homozygous

IDEAS
not able to predict extremes/3rd task, struggles with identifying outliers
-> e.g. compare genetic distance between extreme values and mean values
-> models only work with simulated data w.r.t outliers?

1. validate genotype simulation
2. phenotypic simulation + validation are different

no enviornmental simulation?
-> traits with little environmental interaction
-> traits that mostly depend on genome?
but environmental interaction is important
-> e.g. one year with environmental impact + without
yield is important trait

genotypes, phenotypes of parental lines and F5 generation data available

top 10 hits/top 10% and also whole population distribution both for model output
-> different optimization tasks (mean <-> outliers)
-> increasing top 10% also increases bottom 10%??

heb25 barley -> crossing with wild type

benefit of CNN over RF?

neutral theory not necessary since breeding, not selection
