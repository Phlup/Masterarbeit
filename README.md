## Description
This is the code and data repository for a population genetics-based genotype simulator and ML-based phenotype prediction pipeline for plant breeding.
The pipeline is capable of effectively simulating the development of plant breeding populations across different mating designs and species-specific recombination parameters.
Given estimated marker effects in an additive phenotype model, it is capable of predicting phenotypic summary statistics based on genotypic data of potential parent crosses
and their simulated offspring. The method is validated on genotypic and phenotypic data of multiple studies on 25 maize NAM populations across multiple phenotypic traits
(see (1) for genotype data, (2) and (3) for phenotype data). The genotype simulator based on fixed breeding pedigrees is an extension of the population genetics tools
msprime (https://github.com/tskit-dev/msprime) and tskit (https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit). The ML-based phenotype prediction uses CNNs, RandomForests, XGBoost and baseline models.
See below for an overview of the file structure, execution order of scripts to reproduce results and visualized data-flow in the pipeline.
